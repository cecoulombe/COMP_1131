 * Assignment 2 Question 2: The area of a triangle can be caucluated using Heron's formula, whjich uses the length of the
 *  three sides a, b, and c and the semi-perimiter s. Write an application that reads the values for a, b, and c, then 
 * determines and displays the areas. Prompt for each of the three values individually.
 *      Testing: Include text exhibits for the following sets of inputs:
 *          0, 0, 0 = 0.0
 *          3, 4, 5 = 6.0
 *          1, 1, 1 = 0.433 ...
 *          4, 7, 9 = 13.416 ...
