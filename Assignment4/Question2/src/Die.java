 * Assignment 4 Question 1: Modify the Die class so that it can be used to simulate any of the five possible regular dice. The class 
 * requires the following methods and/or modifications:
 *      * A constructor with no parameters that creates a default 6-sided die
 *      * A consturctor with one parameter that indicates how many faces the die is to have. Check that it is one of the permitted 
 *      values, otehrwise default to a 6-sided die.
 *      * The roll() method given needs to be modified to work within the number of faces established by the constructors.
 *      * The setFaceValue() method needs to have logic added to ensure the new incoming face value is within the allowable limits 
 *      for the number of faces.
 *      * A second get_ method that retrieves the textual name of the current face value, such as One, Two, Thre, &c. Note that a 
 *      single method i expected that will work with any of the five regular dice.
 *      * The toString() method should return both the numeric value and textual name for the current face value in a form like "1 : 
 *      One".
