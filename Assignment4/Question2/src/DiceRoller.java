 * Assignment 4 Question 1: The Die class presented in Listing 5.2 of the textbook models a standard cubic die with faces 1 through 6. 
 * It is also possible to have regular dice with 4 sides (tetrahedron), 8 sides (octahedron), 12 sides (dodecahedron), and 20 sides 
 * (icosahedron).
 * 
 * For your design, create a UML Class diagram similar to Figure 5.5 on page 180 of the textbook. Note that you need to include the 
 * constructors in the methods section.
 * 
 *      Testing: Write a test driver that exercises this class as follows: 
 *          * Instantiates a 6-sided die using the default constructor, then outputs the result of 12 rolls.
 *          * Create one of each of the five regular dice using the second constructor. For each, output the results from number of 
 *          rolls that is double the number of faces created
 *          * Attempt to create a die with an illegal number of faces then output the results of 10 rolls.
