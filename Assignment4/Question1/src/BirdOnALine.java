 * Assignment 4 Question 1: Design and implement a class called Bird, which represents a bird hopping along a horizontal powerline. 
 * The bird can only hop for one unit of distance at a time, in the direction it is facing. The bird can also turn to reverse its 
 * direction. Bird requires a toString  method to return both the current position and the direction facing to the driver so it can 
 * be output. No set or get methods are required for this question.
 * 
 * For your design, create a UML class diagram similar to Figure 5.5 on page 180 of the textbook. Note that you need to incluce the 
 * constructor in the methods section if you code a constructor.
 *      Hint: Remember that a horizontal number line has a zero position in the middle with positive to the right and neative to the 
 *      left. It is your diesing choice whether the bird will land on the middle of the powerline or at some random point between two
 *      limits.
 *
 *      Testing: Write an interactive test driver that instantiates a Bird, then allows the user to manipulate it with simple commands 
 *      like Output (to see the position and direction), Hop, Turn, Exit... single letters work just fine. All output must be via the 
 *      driver not methods within Bird.. You should use this driver to create screenshot exhibits for a number of scenarios (e.g. 
 *      output original state, hop a few times, output, hop a few more times, output, turn, output, hop, output, turn, output, &c.)
 *
