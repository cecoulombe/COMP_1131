 * Assignment 5 Question 2: The Die class given in Listin 5-2 of Chapter 5 is to be used for the basis of this project. 
 * Complete this design so that the toString() method return includes a textual representation as well as the number, 
 * e.g. "1 : One" instead of just 1. This logic should use an array to provide a lookup of the appropriate text name. 
 * 
 * Use this completed class to design and complement a class called DiceSet that simulates a set of multiple dice. The 
 * design should store i to N objects of the Die class using a one-dimensional array. The constructor should dynamically 
 * allocate the number of dice needed based on a parameter. Include a method to roll all the dice in the set and a 
 * toString to show the contents of the set. Document your design with a UML Class diagram, that is to be submitted along 
 * with the testing exhibits. 
 *      Testing: Create a separate driver class that creates several different size sets, including 1, 2, and 5. Then 
 *      output the results of 10 rolls of each set.
